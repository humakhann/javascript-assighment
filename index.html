<!-- QUES1-Create the Example for Logical Operators ? -->
ANS-Logical operators help you set up conditions for access:
1-AND operator (&&): Player's age must be greater than 18 AND they must have a premium membership.
age = 19
premium_membership = True

if age > 18 and premium_membership:
    print("You can access the game!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you cannot access the game.")

If the age is 20 and the player has a premium membership, they get access. Otherwise, they're denied access.

2-OR operator (||): Player can access if they are either a premium member or if they have a special pass.
premium_membership = False
special_pass = True

if premium_membership or special_pass:
    print("You can access the game!")
else:
    print("Sorry, you cannot access the game.")

    If the player has a premium membership OR a special pass, they get access.


<!-- QUES2-Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.? -->
ANS-
1: == (Double equals): This checks if two things are equal in value, but it might perform type coercion,
 meaning it can convert the operands to the same type before making the comparison.

For example:

5 == '5' would return true because it converts the string '5' to a number and compares their values.

2: === (Triple equals): This also checks if two things are equal in value, but it's stricter; it doesn’t
 perform type coercion. It checks both the value and the type of the operands.

For example:

5 === '5' would return false because it doesnt convert types; it directly compares a number to a string
 and sees they're different types, so it returns false.
In simple terms, == checks if values are the same after potential type conversions, while === checks for
 both value and type without doing any conversions.

<!-- QUES3-How many operators do we have in JS ? -->
ANS-
1-Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. (+, -, *, /, %, ++, --)

2-Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)

3-Comparison Operators: Compare values and return true or false (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)

4-Logical Operators: Perform logical operations (&&, ||, !)

5-Bitwise Operators: Perform operations on binary representations of numbers (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>)

6-Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand (+, -, ++, --, !)

7-Conditional (Ternary) Operator: A shorthand for an if-else statement (condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse)

8-String Operators: Concatenate strings (+)

These operators allow you to perform different tasks like math, comparisons, logical operations, and more within JavaScript code.

<!-- QUES4-What is use of parseInt in js? -->
ANS-parseInt in JavaScript is a function that takes a string as input and tries to convert it into an integer (a whole number).

In simple words, it helps you change a string that looks like a number into an actual number that you can use for calculations or comparisons.
FOR ex-
let numberString = "123";
let number = parseInt(numberString);
console.log(number); // This will output: 123

It takes a string like "123" and turns it into the number 123. This is useful when you have user inputs
 or data from sources where numbers are represented as strings, and you need to use them as actual
 numbers in your JavaScript code.

<!-- Ques5-Take input from user and find the odd and even number.? -->
ANS-JavaScript that takes input from the user and determines if it's an odd or even number

// Take input from the user using prompt
let userInput = prompt("Enter a number:");

// Convert the user input from string to a number
let number = parseInt(userInput);

// Check if the number is valid and not NaN
if (!isNaN(number)) {
    if (number % 2 === 0) {
        console.log(number + " is an even number.");
    } else {
        console.log(number + " is an odd number.");
    }
} else {
    console.log("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.");
}


This script uses prompt to take input from the user, then converts the input to a number using parseInt.
 It checks if the number is valid and then uses the modulo operator % to determine if the number is even
  or odd. If the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.
